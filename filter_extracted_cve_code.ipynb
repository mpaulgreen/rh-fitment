    "9. Documentation errors or insufficient warnings (e.g., misleading security guidance, incomplete installation instructions, undocumented features)\n",
    "10. Missing security headers without exploitable code (e.g., absent Content-Security-Policy, missing X-Frame-Options, lack of HSTS)\n",
    "11. Missing patches where the vulnerability is in the unpatched system (e.g., known OS vulnerabilities that simply need vendor updates applied)\n",
    "12. Overly permissive CORS policies without actual code vulnerabilities (e.g., allowing all origins in CORS headers)\n",
    "13. Information disclosure via error messages without exploitable code issues (e.g., stack traces exposed to users, SQL error details shown publicly)\n",
    "14. Weak password policies without implementation flaws (e.g., allowing short passwords, not requiring complexity, no account lockout mechanisms)\n",
    "15. Outdated libraries/dependencies without specific code-related exploitation (e.g., using deprecated frameworks without exploiting known CVEs)\n",
    "16. Self-XSS requiring user interaction without system code flaws (e.g., requiring users to paste malicious code into their own browsers)\n",
    "17. Missing rate limiting without associated code vulnerabilities (e.g., unlimited login attempts, excessive API requests)\n",
    "18. Encrypted data storage issues without cryptographic implementation flaws (e.g., using weak but correctly implemented algorithms like MD5)\n",
    "19. Clickjacking vulnerabilities due only to missing X-Frame-Options headers\n",
    "20. Insecure direct object references that are purely configuration issues\n",
    "21. Open ports without associated exploitable services (e.g., properly functioning services that are unnecessarily exposed)\n",
