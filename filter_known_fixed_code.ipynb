      "2. **CVE-2020-7774**: This vulnerability is code-related as it involves Prototype Pollution, a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate the prototype of a JavaScript object. This can lead to a variety of security issues, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the context.\n",
