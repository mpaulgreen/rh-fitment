    "13. Overly permissive CORS policies without actual code vulnerabilities (e.g., allowing all origins in CORS headers)\n",
    "14. Information disclosure via error messages without exploitable code issues (e.g., stack traces exposed to users, SQL error details shown publicly)\n",

    "16. Outdated libraries/dependencies without specific code-related exploitation (e.g., using deprecated frameworks without exploiting known CVEs)\n",
    "17. Self-XSS requiring user interaction without system code flaws (e.g., requiring users to paste malicious code into their own browsers)\n",
