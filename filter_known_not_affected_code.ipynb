    "13. Information disclosure via error messages without exploitable code issues (e.g., stack traces exposed to users, SQL error details shown publicly)\n",
    "14. Weak password policies without implementation flaws (e.g., allowing short passwords, not requiring complexity, no account lockout mechanisms)\n",
    "15. Outdated libraries/dependencies without specific code-related exploitation (e.g., using deprecated frameworks without exploiting known CVEs)\n",
