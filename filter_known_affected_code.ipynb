      "### Explanation:\n",
      "1. **CVE-2023-43804**: This CVE is related to urllib3, a Python HTTP client library. The issue is that urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP. This seems to be a configuration issue rather than a code-related vulnerability, hence it's not a code-related CVE.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CVE-2023-44270**: This CVE is related to PostCSS, a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins. The issue is that it allows an attacker to prepare CSS in such a way that it will contain parts that can cause harm. This is a code-related vulnerability as it involves the parsing of external untrusted CSS, which can be classified as a form of code injection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CVE-2023-43646**: This CVE is related to get-func-name, a module to retrieve a function's name securely and consistently both in NodeJS and the browser. The issue is that versions prior to 2.0.1 are subject to a regular expression denial of service (redos). This is a code-related vulnerability as it involves a denial of service attack through regular expressions, which is a form of code execution.\n",

    "  \"code_related\": true/false,\n",
    "  \"exclusion_reason\": \"If not code-related, specify the reason from the exclusion criteria list below. Leave blank if code-related.\"\n",
    "}}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exclusion Criteria (if not code-related):\n",
    "1. Configuration errors only (e.g., misconfigured access controls, incorrect firewall rules, improper permission settings, insecure registry keys, misconfigured HTTP headers)\n",
    "2. Physical security issues (e.g., unauthorized physical access, hardware tampering, cable disconnection, side-channel attacks, electromagnetic interference, power analysis attacks)\n",
    "3. Social engineering without code exploits (e.g., phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, voice phishing/vishing)\n",
    "4. Default credentials (e.g., unchanged factory passwords, standard admin accounts, hardcoded test accounts, vendor default usernames/passwords, unchanged SSH keys)\n",
    "5. Policy/procedure violations (e.g., improper access management, missing governance controls, inadequate backup procedures, improper user offboarding, lack of least privilege enforcement)\n",
    "6. Expired certificates (e.g., SSL/TLS certificate expiration, outdated cryptographic signatures, revoked certificates still in use, expired code signing certificates)\n",
    "7. Denial of Service that doesn't involve code manipulation (e.g., resource exhaustion through legitimate requests, TCP/SYN flooding, ICMP flooding, bandwidth consumption attacks)\n",
    "8. Hardware-based issues with no software component (e.g., power supply failures, CPU vulnerabilities like Spectre/Meltdown, faulty memory modules, compromised firmware that isn't patchable via software)\n",
    "9. Documentation errors or insufficient warnings (e.g., misleading security guidance, incomplete installation instructions, undocumented features)\n",
    "10. Missing security headers without exploitable code (e.g., absent Content-Security-Policy, missing X-Frame-Options, lack of HSTS)\n",
    "11. Missing patches where the vulnerability is in the unpatched system (e.g., known OS vulnerabilities that simply need vendor updates applied)\n",
    "12. Overly permissive CORS policies without actual code vulnerabilities (e.g., allowing all origins in CORS headers)\n",
    "13. Information disclosure via error messages without exploitable code issues (e.g., stack traces exposed to users, SQL error details shown publicly)\n",
    "14. Weak password policies without implementation flaws (e.g., allowing short passwords, not requiring complexity, no account lockout mechanisms)\n",
    "15. Outdated libraries/dependencies without specific code-related exploitation (e.g., using deprecated frameworks without exploiting known CVEs)\n",
    "16. Self-XSS requiring user interaction without system code flaws (e.g., requiring users to paste malicious code into their own browsers)\n",
    "17. Missing rate limiting without associated code vulnerabilities (e.g., unlimited login attempts, excessive API requests)\n",
    "18. Encrypted data storage issues without cryptographic implementation flaws (e.g., using weak but correctly implemented algorithms like MD5)\n",
    "19. Clickjacking vulnerabilities due only to missing X-Frame-Options headers\n",
    "20. Insecure direct object references that are purely configuration issues\n",
    "21. Open ports without associated exploitable services (e.g., properly functioning services that are unnecessarily exposed)\n",
    "22. Directory listing enabled on web servers without sensitive information exposure\n",
    "23. Excessive error verbosity without actual exploitable vulnerabilities\n",
    "24. Unencrypted data transmissions where encryption was possible but not implemented\n",
    "25. Cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities due solely to missing tokens\n",
    "26. Inappropriate cookie settings (e.g., missing secure or HttpOnly flags) without code-based exploitation paths\n",
    "27. Unvalidated redirects that don't lead to code execution or information disclosure\n",
    "28. Unnecessary service accounts with proper permissions (a configuration choice, not a code issue)\n",
    "29. Server-side request forgery (SSRF) protection bypass via DNS rebinding without code flaws\n",
